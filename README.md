hello everyone Nakul here
i am a delhi base front-end web developer 
i hade made this project 6 month ago and today i deploying it with some changes like delet button and if you will use it on laptop so can also use the laptop numeric keys instead of calculater's button and you can either use calculater's equal button or keyboard's equal key and entre key for the sum value

NOTE: if you use keyboard's key only than use enter for sum value do not use enter if you are using the calculater's buttons
